        "The USGS Flood Inundation Mapping Program has two main functions:",
        "1) Partner with local communities to assist with the development and validation of flood inundation map libraries. A flood inundation map library is a set of maps that shows where flooding may occur over a range of water levels in the community's local stream or river. The USGS works with communities to identify an appropriate stream section, gather the necessary data to model where flooding will likely occur, and verify that the maps produced are scientifically sound.",
        "2) Provide online access to flood inundation maps along with real-time streamflow data, flood forecasts, and potential loss estimates. Once a community's map library is complete, it is uploaded to the FIM Web application, an online public mapping application. This web application allows users to explore the full set of inundation maps that shows where flooding would occur given a selected stream condition. Users can also access historical flood information and potential loss estimates based on the severity of the flood. The FIM Web Application helps communities visualize potential flooding scenarios, identify areas and resources that may be at risk, and enhance their local response effort during a flooding event."
