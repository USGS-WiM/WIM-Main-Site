					<p class="bio">In 2017 I was working as a plant geneticist and not feeling like I was in the right lane when an opportunity to work as a GIS intern with the BLM opened up. After having done a GIS course in undergrad, I knew the field interested me so I took a chance and took the leap. I was blessed with a mentor who also pushed me to learn Python at the same time and I was hooked on programming. Recently, I received my M.S. in Natural Resource Science (GIS and Remote Sensing) from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. I used Google Earth Engine and its Javascript API and loved the ability to share my code with collaborators to solve problems, further enabling my coding addiction. I've worked for the federal government in the past, first as the aformentioned GIS intern and then as a spatial coordinator (contractor) with the NRCS, and greatly enjoyed my experieces. I describe myself as a geospatial nerd as I think the discipline has so many interesting facets and constantly provides opportunities to learn new things.

						Out in the wild, I am an avid partaker in too many hobbies. I spend most of my time hiking, playing sports, reading, culinary (baking, cooking, cheesemaking), and getting my hands dirty in the garden or in the woodshop. I also have two adorable cats, Merwin and Yzma, who earn their keep by cuddling either me or my partner Mirae.</p>

I then spent the next few years working for an environmental community center (Urban Ecology Center) as their GIS and Field Data Coordinator in Milwaukee, WI where I worked on engaging the community in helping monitor wildlife and conducting research as a means of understanding biodiversity change in an urban area. While I really enjoyed doing this work and got to dabble in some technical work, I was left with a desire to dive deeper into web development, databases, and programming. This led me to pursue a Masters of GIS at the University of Minnesota that I started in January of 2022. I attended a virtual job fair where I was able to chat with the WIM team and now here I am! Other than that, I am an avid birder and disc golfer and like to cross-country ski in the winter. I think it would be awesome to start a biathlon club centered around xc skiing and putting with frisbees!</p>
