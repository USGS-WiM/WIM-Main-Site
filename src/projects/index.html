						<div class = "project-page">StreamStats is a Web-based Geographic Information
							 Systems (GIS) application that provides users with access to an assortment of analytical tools that are useful for a variety of water-resources planning and management purposes, and for engineering and design purposes. StreamStats users can select USGS data-collection station locations shown on a map and obtain previously published information for the stations. Users also can select any location along a stream and obtain the drainage-basin boundary, basin characteristics, and estimates of streamflow statistics for the location. The streamflow statistics that StreamStats can provide for data-collection stations and for user-selected ungaged sites vary among the implemented states and among data-collection stations within states.
							<br><br>WIM began collaborating with the USGS Water Mission Area StreamStats development team in 2014, and has since taken the technical and architecture lead in web development. To keep StreamStats on the forefront of web technology, WIM has moved StreamStats away from a proprietary monolithic application to an ecosystem of web applications and services allowing for more flexibility and extensibility. Adapting an industry-standard database, web service, and client architecture model has allowed development of numerous APIs and clients to allow for external development on this key system as well better integration possibilities within the USGS. WIM looks forward to continued involvement in the project, adding additional features and functionality to StreamStats as well as integrating with other Water Mission Area systems and services.

						<div class = "project-page"> The USGS Flood Inundation Mapping Program has two main functions: <br><br>
							1) Partner with local communities to assist with the development and validation of flood inundation map libraries. A flood inundation map library is a set of maps that shows where flooding may occur over a range of water levels in the community's local stream or river. The USGS works with communities to identify an appropriate stream section, gather the necessary data to model where flooding will likely occur, and verify that the maps produced are scientifically sound.
							<br><br>
							2) Provide online access to flood inundation maps along with real-time streamflow data, flood forecasts, and potential loss estimates. Once a community's map library is complete, it is uploaded to the FIM Web application, an online public mapping application. This web application allows users to explore the full set of inundation maps that shows where flooding would occur given a selected stream condition. Users can also access historical flood information and potential loss estimates based on the severity of the flood. The FIM Web Application helps communities visualize potential flooding scenarios, identify areas and resources that may be at risk, and enhance their local response effort during a flooding event.
							<br><br>
							WIM has lead development and technical operations of the USGS FIM program since inception. In collaboration with the Water Mission Area and other Water Science Center personnel, WIM has provided FIM map services, supported the development and deployment of new FIM sites, and maintained an interactive web application to serve the public.

							<div class = "project-page">SPARROW (SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes) models estimate the amount of a contaminant transported from inland watersheds to larger water bodies by linking monitoring data with information on watershed characteristics and contaminant sources. SPARROW models are used to estimate long-term average values of water characteristics, such as the amount of a contaminant that is delivered downstream, on the basis of existing monitoring data, location and strength of contaminant sources, and characteristics of the landscape. <br><br>
								These interactive map applications are designed around comprehensive user-defined map selections with dynamic graphs and tables to visualize underlying data. The flexible, map-based approach to viewing SPARROW models helps managers visualize thousands to millions of data points to determine how to reduce loads of contaminants and design protection strategies; design strategies to meet regulatory requirements; predict changes in water quality that might result from management actions; and identify gaps and priorities in monitoring.
								<br><br>
								In collaboration with local and national SPARROW modelers, WIM has produced several generations of SPARROW online interactive map viewers to highlight the amount of data produced by this powerful model.

							In collaboration with the National Wildlife Health Center and with a grant from the National Biosurveillance Integration Center, WIM developed WHISPers version 2 to modernize the application architecture, user interface, and increase the data management and data sharing capabilities of the system; with the ultimate goal of making wildlife mortality and morbidity data more accessible to all interested parties.

							The Wetlands mapper is designed to deliver easy-to-use, map like views of America's Wetland resources.

The Wetlands Mapper fulfills the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's strategic plan for the development, revision and dissemination of wetlands data and information to resource managers and the public. This information is intended to promote the understanding and conservation of wetland resources through discovery and education as well as to aid in resource management, research and decision making.

							WIM personnel and the FWS wetlands group made use of an inter-agency agreement in 2000s to co-develop this key resource. This Federal partnership has yielded tremendous benefits in ongoing efforts to configure, improve and distribute the wetlands map information using newer technologies in digital mapping and web-serving capabilities.

							One of the major goals of the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Water-Quality Assessment project is to answer the question “Has water quality been changing over time?”. To support that goal, they have conducted long-term consistent and comparable monitoring on streams and rivers throughout the Nation since 1992. Other USGS programs, as well as many other Federal, State, regional, and local monitoring organizations, also have collected long-term water-quality data to support their own assessments of changing water- quality conditions. Data from these organizations have been aggregated, screened, standardized, and used to support the most comprehensive assessment of stream-quality trends conducted to date in the United States. Collectively, these trend results will be used to provide insight into how natural features and human activities have contributed to water-quality changes over time in the Nation's streams and rivers.

							WIM worked closely with USGS scientists to develop and release this interactive map interface with the release of their trends report.
